#### Java programming exercises
Consist of variable programms based on Java which were made for methods of programming class. 
At the end of each program are given possible inputs and the coressponding outputs.

* Maximum Subarray Problem using Kadane's algorithm
* Number of Possible Triangles - complexity O(n^2)
* Changing Notation INF <-> ONP
* Trains (operations: create new train, insert carriage, delete carriage etc.)
* Knapsack Problem - recursive and iterative version of algorithm
